# Adaboost-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project implements the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm from scratch using Python. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. It is widely used for classification tasks and works by giving more weight to the instances that were misclassified by previous classifiers.
